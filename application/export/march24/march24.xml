      <field name="planningComitteeBodyCopy title">May Day is a holiday for the 99%. It is a day for people to come together, across all those lines which too often divide us — race, class, gender, religion — and challenge the systems that create these divisions. When we come together, we recognize the common struggles we face and the common interests we have. With this collective power we can begin to build the world we want to see. Another world is possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 align="center" style="vertical-spacing:0" vspace="0"&gt;On May 1st, 2012&lt;/h3&gt; Millions of people throughout the world — workers, students, immigrants, professionals, houseworkers&amp;nbsp;— employed and unemployed alike — will take to the streets to unite in a General Strike against a system that does not work for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't go to work.  Don't go to school.  Don't shop. Take the streets!</field>

Whether we are looking for work, facing ever decreasing hours, braving dangerous working conditions for a paycheck that barely provides the means to survive, returning day after day to the boring jobs that drain our souls and prevent us from seeing our loved ones, collecting debt like a hobby because education, housing, and the cost of life are impossible to afford...it has become clear that the systems of the 1% were not created to support us and are incapable of doing so. Yet these very systems rely on our labor, our skills, and our compliance to function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1% needs us to continue reaping profits, but WE DON'T NEED THE 1%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This May Day, Occupy Wall Street, in coalition with numerous other organizations and occupations, calls for a day without the 99%: No Work, No School, No Shopping, No Housework, No Compliance. Let's take the streets, reclaim our communities, and support each other. NOT the 1%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't strike call in sick, if you can't call in sick hold a slow down. We know how to shut it down because we're the ones that prop it up. If we continue to stand by while the 1% descimates our economy and destabalizes our lives, we will be powerless to challenge the forces that oppress us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 1st, let us stand together to reclaim our jobs, our communities, our lives. Withdraw your consent and strike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If you throw one stone, it's a punishable offense. If one thousand stones are thrown, it's political action."&lt;/em&gt;

      <field name="blurb">May Day is a holiday during which no traditional work is done, and yet is a day explicitly about work. It's a day for recognizing that we are all workers, whether we're rank-and-file union members, the precariously employed, students, or stay-at-home parents. It's a day to recognize the value of our work, and the power we have to collectively change our working conditions and our world. By simply stepping out of the systems of production that confine and alienate us, we can transform the conditions of society itself. May 1st is a day to explore the possibility of communities based on mutual aid rather than exploitation and consumption. Unlike Christmas, Halloween, Valentine’s Day, and pretty much every major holiday in the U.S., you don't have to buy anything and you don't have to work feverishly in advance to celebrate May Day. &lt;a href="http://199.119.177.51/maydaynyc/step-up"&gt;You can make it what you want it to be.&lt;/a&gt; In fact, that's really the only thing you have to do to celebrate May Day. It’s a day for and full of human potential. What will you make of it?</field>
